# Feed Reader Jasmine Testing

The project is about testing for functionality of the website.
All the tests were added in `jasmine/spec/feedreader.js`.

The tests are:

- RSS feeds are defined.
- Each feed has a URL defined and the URL is not empty.
- Each feed has a name defined and the name is not empty.
- The menu element is hidden by default.
- The menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked.
- There is at least one .entry element within the .feed container.
- A new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes.
